## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


# LivvEpic - because, one life!

As our brand with its tagline says, this is all about making the best of what we have in this life.

Living epic is not something unachievable, but we can very much exceed our own expectations. We just need some tools to do so. That is what we are trying here to achieve of ourselves and to others, after all helping others is what makes us rich.

But to get there first we need to 
# Get our Basics Right : A.k.a. The Needs!
Needs are those basics which all living beings need and strive for, including us humans just for survival. To keep it simple, it is food, water, air, shelter & clothing. Once they are established, then we would 'WANT' to thrive. But basics are vital and important for survival, health & longevity.

## Survive
 To survive, we the ingenious humans have devised all sorts of magic over centuries of time to tackle them easily. However, there were many shortcuts taken which has resulted in the mess that we today call as 'Global Warming'. At this point is where we diverge, the Believers are gonna believe and the nay-sayers aren't. At LivvEpic, all we care is sustainability. But, having said that, things are working for now so lets skip ahead and Thrive! ðŸ˜ˆ

## Thrive
 Now, here we are. Let's see how can we not only survive or even just thrive, but also keep our planet happy and healthy for generations to come, while rocking out lives.
